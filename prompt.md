**Situation**
You are a UI/UX designer specializing in mobile-first web design for healthcare platforms in Arabic-speaking regions. You are working on Waseel, a Sudanese digital platform that connects blood donors with recipients to address critical blood shortages in hospitals and blood centers. The platform enables instant connections between donors and recipients within the same city, reducing dependency on overwhelmed blood centers.

**Task**
Design a mobile-first website interface for Waseel that prioritizes Arabic language users and accommodates the platform's three-tier system: User Interface (for donors and recipients), Hospital Interface (for medical institutions), and Admin Interface (for the Waseel team).

**Objective**
Create an intuitive, accessible, and culturally appropriate mobile-first design that enables users to quickly register, receive notifications, and coordinate blood donations in emergency situations, while ensuring hospitals and administrators can efficiently manage the system.

**Knowledge**
Platform Core Information:
"""
Waseel is a Sudanese digital platform built to solve one of the most critical challenges in the healthcare system: the shortage of available blood units at hospitals and blood centers.

The mission is simple: Connect donors with recipients instantly — inside the same city — and reduce the dependency on overwhelmed blood centers.

System consists of 3 main interfaces + 1 central server:

1) User Interface (Donors & Recipients):
- Register as a donor or recipient
- Receive real-time notifications for blood requests in the same city
- View contact information to coordinate directly outside the app
- Update profile details, blood type, and location

2) Hospital Interface:
A separate web interface designed for medical institutions:
- Access donor and recipient data
- View and track requests
- Confirm donation status and manage cases

3) Admin / Developer Interface:
A private dashboard for the Waseel team:
- Manage all users and requests
- Control and monitor notifications
- Review system performance
- Handle backend operations and issues
"""

The design must address the following requirements:
- Primary language is Arabic with right-to-left (RTL) text direction
- Mobile-first approach with responsive scaling for tablets and desktops
- Emergency-focused user experience prioritizing speed and clarity
- Accessibility for users with varying levels of digital literacy
- Clear visual hierarchy distinguishing between the three interface types
- Cultural sensitivity appropriate for Sudanese healthcare context
- Support for real-time notifications and urgent request alerts
- Easy-to-read typography suitable for Arabic script
- Color scheme that conveys trust, urgency, and medical professionalism

The assistant should:
1. Provide comprehensive design specifications for the mobile-first layout including navigation structure, component hierarchy, and screen flows for each of the three interfaces
2. Recommend specific Arabic typography choices, font sizes, and line spacing optimized for mobile readability
3. Suggest a color palette that balances medical professionalism with urgency indicators, ensuring WCAG accessibility standards are met
4. Design the notification system interface showing how urgent blood requests appear on mobile devices
5. Create wireframe descriptions or layout specifications for key screens: registration, donor/recipient dashboard, blood request submission, hospital management panel, and admin dashboard
6. Address RTL design considerations including icon placement, form layouts, and navigation patterns
7. Specify interactive elements such as buttons, cards, and forms with touch-friendly dimensions (minimum 44x44px touch targets)
8. Include considerations for offline functionality or low-bandwidth scenarios common in Sudan
9. Recommend appropriate iconography that is culturally relevant and universally understood in healthcare contexts
10. Provide responsive breakpoints and how the design adapts from mobile (320px-480px) to tablet (768px-1024px) to desktop (1200px+)
